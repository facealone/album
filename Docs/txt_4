Common Problems / Solutions

ITEM: I'm getting errors!

Well, that's not enough information.  First run album with "-d" to see what's
happening, and if you can't figure out the problem from that, check this page
to see if your error is mentioned here.  If not, then you can <a href='/Contact/'>send me</a>
the following information:
1) The error (all of the output from "album -d")
2) Your operating system
3) The version of ImageMagick (first line from "convert -h")

ITEM: I get: <i>"album: No such file or directory"</i>?

1) Try specifying the full path to album, such as:

<code>% ./album</code>

Or

<code>% /usr/local/bin/album</code>

2) Make sure perl is installed in /usr/bin/perl

3) If you save the perl scripts as text from IE, it may screwup the
   line breaks, instead use save as source.

ITEM: My thumbnails are too big

Some cameras store thumbnails in the profile info of the images,
and this gets saved by convert when it creates new images.  One
solution is to try adding:

<code>% album --scale_opts +profile \\\* -- &lt;rest of album arguments here...&gt;</code>

Some versions of ImageMagick will complain with this.  You can also try:

<code>% album --scale_opts -profile /dev/null -- ....</code>

On Windows with ActivePerl you'll need to specify a trash file instead of /dev/null

You can also do this to your medium images with --med_scale_opts.

If that doesn't make your thumbnails small enough, you can lower the
quality with something like:

<code>% album --scale_opts -quality 5 -- ....</code>

You can combine the --scale_opts as well:

<code>% album --scale_opts +profile \\\* -quality 5 -- ....</code>

ITEM: I don't want to have to regenerate all my albums when I add photos

Great, neither do I.

First of all, unless you specify -force, album won't generate new medium
or thumbnail images, it will only generate new HTML.  But this can take
time, and can also be avoided.

If you handle albums like me, then new photos go into a new directory
which is placed in an album with other subalbums (that are already
generated).  To update the new directory (with the proper parent album
links and theme) and add it to the top directory, you can do:

  % album -add photos/new_vacation_pictures

ITEM: My index pages are too large!

I get many requests to break up the index pages after reaching a certain
threshold of images.

The problem is that this is hard to manage - unless the index pages are
treated just like sub-albums, then you now have three major components
on a page, more indexes, more albums, and thumbnails.  And not only is
that cumbersome, but it would require updating all the themes.

Hopefully the next major release of album will do this, but until then
there is another, easier solution - just break the images up into
subdirectories before running album.

I have a tool that will move new images into subdirectories for you and
then runs album:

ITEM: <b>ERROR:</b> no delegate for this image format (./album)

You have the album script in your photo directory and it can't make
a thumbnail of itself!  Either:
1) Move album out of the photo directory (suggested)
2) Run album with -known_images

ITEM: <b>ERROR:</b> no delegate for this image format (some_non_image_file)

Don't put non-images in your photo directory, or else run with -known_images

ITEM: <b>ERROR:</b> no delegate for this image format (some.jpg)
ITEM: <b>ERROR:</b> identify: JPEG library is not available (some.jpg)

Your ImageMagick installation isn't complete and doesn't know how
to handle the given image type.

ITEM: <b>ERROR:</b> Can't get [some_image] size from -verbose output.

ImageMagick doesn't know the size of the image specified.  Either:
1) Your ImageMagick installation isn't complete and can't handle the image type.
2) You are running album on a directory with non-images in it without
   using the -known_images option.

If you're a <a href='http://MarginalHacks.com/redir.cgi?http://Gentoo.org/'>gentoo linux</a> user and you see this error, then run this command
as root (thanks Alex Pientka):

  USE="avi gif jpeg mpeg png quicktime tiff" emerge imagemagick
