Feature Requests, Bugs and Patches

ITEM: Feature Requests

If there's something you want added to album, first make sure
it doesn't already exist!  Check the man page or the usage:

<code>% man album</code>
<code>% album -h</code>

Also see -more and -More options.

If you don't see it there, consider writing a patch or a plugin.

ITEM: Bug reports

Before you submit a bug, please make sure you have the most current release of album!

When submitting a bug, I need to know <b>at least</b>:

1) Your operating system
2) The exact problem and the exact error messages

I'd also like to know, if possible:
1) The exact album command you ran
2) The output from the command

And I generally also need the debug output of album:

<code>% album -d</code>

Finally, make sure that you've got the most current
version of album, and the most current themes as well.

ITEM: Writing Patches, Modifying album

If you want to modify album, you might want to check with me
first to make sure it's not already on my development plate.

If not, then consider writing it as a plugin instead of patching
the album source.  This avoids adding complexity to album for
features that may not be globally used.
[[plugin support is expected to be included in the 3.1 release]]

If it needs to go into album (for example, if it's a bug), then
please make sure to first download the most <a href='http://MarginalHacks.com/bin/album'>recent copy of album</a>
first, then patch that and send me either a diff, a patch, or the
full script.  If you comment off the changes you make that'd be great too.

ITEM: Known Bugs

v3.10:  Burning CDs doesn't quite work with theme absolute paths.
v3.11:  -clear_* and -no_* doesn't clear out parent directory options.
