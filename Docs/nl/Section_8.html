<b><a name='Language_Support_Details'>1:</a>   Language Support Details</b>

Language support is coming soon.  I need volunteers to do translations
for me, specifically of:

1) The Mini How-To.  Please translate from the <a href="txt_2">source</a>.
2) album messages, as listed below.

If you are willing to do the translation of either one or both
of these items, please contact me!

Also be sure to let me know how you want to be credited,
by your name, name and email, or name and website.

And please include the proper spelling and capitalization of the
name of your language <b>in your language</b>.  For example, "français"
instead of the "French"

I am open to suggestions for what charset to use.  Current options are:

1) HTML characters such as [&amp;eacute;]] (though they only work in browsers)
2) Unicode (UTF) such as [Ã©] (though again, only in browsers)
3) ASCII code, where possible, such as [é] (works in text editors, though
   not currently in this page because it's set to unicode)

<b><a name='Album_messages'>2:</a>   Album messages</b>

Here's a full list of messages I need translated.  If you can only
do a portion of the list, that could still be helpful.

Ignore anything that starts with "##" - that's just for organization.

## INSTALLATION
##

I see this is your first time running album

I'm going to do some simple installations for you.

I'll save your installation in:
You can edit this file later to suit your needs.
** Run $PROGNAME as root if you want to do a system-wide configuration. **

- Plugins already installed correctly
I see that you haven't installed plugins yet.  Would you like to do that now?
data path for installing plugins
I'm going to install your plugins, pick a data path to install into:
Couldn't install plugins!
Please login as a user with the appropriate privileges and copy:
Cancelled install
Move the plugin directory into your data path to install later

If album has problems finding themes, make sure they're in:
Or edit conf to set their new location
I see that the -theme_path does not currently exist:
Would you like to try to install the themes there?
Couldn't install themes!
Please login as a user with the appropriate privileges and copy:

You can also specify a default -theme_url path.  This is useful if the
mapping between your file path and URLs are not clear, for example if:

1) You have virtual domains (in some cases).
2) You're using mod_rewrite on the themes path.
3) You use a symbolic link to point to the actual themes directory.$num3

In general if you don't know what these mean, then you probably don't
need to specify -theme_url.  Usually the filesystem and URL match after
you remove the web root directory.  Otherwise, this should be the URL
that you can put in your browser to see a listing of the theme directories.

If you run album on a local machine and then upload your album to your
web server, then you will need to upload the themes as well, this is
where you would specify the URL to the directory with the themes in it.

Do you want to specify a -theme_url?
Some reasonable values:  /Themes/,  http://yourdomain.com/Themes/
The -theme_url value should not contain any spaces

End of configuration

Continuing with album run

Attempting to move:
Move successful

I see you specified the -theme_path.  Using:
..but I can't find the directory!

You should specify the option: 'theme_path
You can override this value on the command-line: -theme_path

You need to put them in a directory *inside* your web path.
If you can't find the themes from your web browser, then any
images or css you use will not be displayed.

This is the path to the themes on the machine that you run album on, not
a URL.  A good location is a directory inside the web root, something like:

Just hit return if you don't want themes.

** Default is the dpkg install of album **
Found local directory
