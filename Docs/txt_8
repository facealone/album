Plugins, Usage, Creation,..

ITEM: What are Plugins?

Plugins are snippets of code that allow you to modify the behavior
of album.  They can be as simple as a new way to create EXIF captions,
to something as complex as creating the album based on a database of
images instead of using the filesystem hierarchy.

ITEM: How do I use them?

You don't yet.  Plugin support code is being finished up now and when
it's done we'll have some info here.
